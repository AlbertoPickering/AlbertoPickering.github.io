 ORIGINAL COPYRIGHT
All My creative work; from words, lines, sketches, illustrations, 3D models, renders, photography, videos, sounds, Music, code, plans, etc. are original made from scratch Designs in most cases not even visual references I use. If You wanto to learn more, please take your time consulting the 🇫🇷 Code de la Propriété Intelectuelle: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/texte_lc/LEGITEXT000006069414/

COMMERCIAL RIGHTS
There are many other commercial projects that include My original artwork in different formats and techniques, alone or together or mixed with content previously made by other Humans and Software, all that content was provide to Me by My Clients and/or their Providers and I was granted with the permission to use it, modified, change it, etc. in its total or parts. As I was hired to create, edit, modified, etc. and the end result is different of the originals, I reserve My right as Designer to show it as part of My creative portfolio; respecting the Names and Brands and giving them the credit and respect they deserve, assuring that I will never use their content for any other motive than mention them as Professional Contacts that trusted Me.

SPECULATIVE CREATIONS
As well there are many other cases where My creative work was speculative and I used references to suggest a change with the intention of improvement and start Business relationships. In those cases every Name, Brand and Product can be sure that I do not compete with them or use their public information for any other motive than show My capabilities as Creative Professional. OTHER CONTENT In the case of other content shown used by Me over decades of work; at the time of use, I payed for it, had the permission or licences of use, always been sure of respect international Copyright laws as well as Creative Commons, Public Domain, Open Source, Royalty free, etc.

PATENTS
In any case can be coincidences and those cases I respect and defend the original creations and in the unlikely case of duplicated Patents or original creations that where not documented or registered, I trust in the European Patent Office and European Copyright Legislation as helpers in clearing any doubts for the good of Humanity and Nature.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH
As a Desktop Publisher, Graphic Artist, Web Developer and Musician; I use My right of Liberté d’ Expression, hopping to never harm any feelings and taking care of age of the Public Audience. If humour surprises respect, please contact Me.

GOVERNMENT
I want to left clear than in any case My work, even if is intended for restricted use or use by Defence, has intentions to destroy Life or Nature in Earth or Space. Like in the case of illustrations or 3D models that where created for media, video games, publishing, education, etc. In the case of creative content that can be useful to Government; My Country, the République Française 🇫🇷 has My permission as French Citizen to copy My work for any good motive and It will be an honour to help further on a creative project. TOOLS The tools and mediums I use to work are My property, I own perpetual Software Licences. In some cases I had rented Software and Services and I always respect the times of use, but the resulted work and my right of use over the creations made does not expire.

BACKGROUND
I am by career an Industrial Designer and Technical Draftsman, a member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts and DRUPA Visitor. I have took many courses in Person and online in different fields as; Design, Illustration, Painting, Architecture, Modelling, 3D Modelling, Animation, Web Development, Apps. Development, Computer Programming, Print, Physics, Hunting, Defence, Martial Arts, Survival, Mechanics, Electronics, Mobility, History, Music Production, Photography, Cine, Manufacturing, Arts, Tourism, Services, Sound, Medicine, Navigation, etc. I lost count of the books and being connected to the internet all My life made the study a habit. Honestly, the more I learn the less I know about Our brief time on this small sphere We call Earth.

HOW TO HIRE ME
I am a French Citizen, Independent Designer and Creative Freelance. I live in Mexico at the moment, I am Mexican too. Write Me to 1@pibr.fr Tell Me about You, explain Me what do you need and after some eMails, PhoneCalls, VideoChats, Messages or Perhaps Meetings We will interchange creative work for the right price. Simple. Never send money to others! I work alone, just Me.

WEBSITE
Me or My Providers do not collect any personal data or information. Unless a Payment transaction is made using a form or Payment Service (I Use PayPal or direct Bank Deposits). Contact forms will only send the provided data to My emails (is the same as writing directly). Perhaps My ISP DataCenters in Canadá and France and Software Providers will identify the kind of web browser You use to enhance the visualising experience in different devices. I avoid the use of Data Bases to increase the security and simplicity of My Web Pages to be able to Update more often. I am My own Webmaster, Designer, Programer, Debugger, Employee and Boss, I work alone, just Me (maybe in the Future My Children like My Business). So if You see an error, remember that I am a Human and please let Me know. If You like My Website or the ones I made for others, I can make one for You too!

CONTACT
In case of any concern please contact Me directly to 1@pibr.fr. Hopefully We can work in the same project. Of course I exist: Mobile: +52 661 101 7012 Address: Av. Dr. Angel Leaño 3056 D-20 Nórdika Residencial Los Robles, Zapopan (Guadalajara) Jalisco, Mexique 45134 N 20º40’00.6” W 103º24’14.6” @ 1601m JUST FOR FANS! fans@pibr.fr instagram.com/albertpickeringbrunel x.com/PickeringBrunel
