 ORIGINAL COPYRIGHT
All My creative work; from words, lines, sketches, illustrations, 3D models, renders, photography, videos, sounds, Music, code, plans, etc. are original made from scratch Designs in most cases not even visual references I use. If You wanto to learn more, please take your time consulting the 🇫🇷 Code de la Propriété Intelectuelle: https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/texte_lc/LEGITEXT000006069414/

COMMERCIAL RIGHTS
There are many other commercial projects that include My original artwork in different formats and techniques, alone or together or mixed with content previously made by other Humans and Software, all that content was provide to Me by My Clients and/or their Providers and I was granted with the permission to use it, modified, change it, etc. in its total or parts. As I was hired to create, edit, modified, etc. and the end result is different of the originals, I reserve My right as Designer to show it as part of My creative portfolio; respecting the Names and Brands and giving them the credit and respect they deserve, assuring that I will never use their content for any other motive than mention them as Professional Contacts that trusted Me.

SPECULATIVE CREATIONS
As well there are many other cases where My creative work was speculative and I used references to suggest a change with the intention of improvement and start Business relationships. In those cases every Name, Brand and Product can be sure that I do not compete with them or use their public information for any other motive than show My capabilities as Creative Professional. OTHER CONTENT In the case of other content shown used by Me over decades of work; at the time of use, I payed for it, had the permission or licences of use, always been sure of respect international Copyright laws as well as Creative Commons, Public Domain, Open Source, Royalty free, etc.

PATENTS
In any case can be coincidences and those cases I respect and defend the original creations and in the unlikely case of duplicated Patents or original creations that where not documented or registered, I trust in the European Patent Office and European Copyright Legislation as helpers in clearing any doubts for the good of Humanity and Nature.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH
As a Desktop Publisher, Graphic Artist, Web Developer and Musician; I use My right of Liberté d’ Expression, hopping to never harm any feelings and taking care of age of the Public Audience. If humour surprises respect, please contact Me.

GOVERNMENT
I want to left clear than in any case My work, even if is intended for restricted use or use by Defence, has intentions to destroy Life or Nature in Earth or Space. Like in the case of illustrations or 3D models that where created for media, video games, publishing, education, etc. In the case of creative content that can be useful to Government; My Country, the République Française 🇫🇷 has My permission as French Citizen to copy My work for any good motive and It will be an honour to help further on a creative project. TOOLS The tools and mediums I use to work are My property, I own perpetual Software Licences. In some cases I had rented Software and Services and I always respect the times of use, but the resulted work and my right of use over the creations made does not expire.

BACKGROUND
I am by career an Industrial Designer and Technical Draftsman, a member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts and DRUPA Visitor. I have took many courses in Person and online in different fields as; Design, Illustration, Painting, Architecture, Modelling, 3D Modelling, Animation, Web Development, Apps. Development, Computer Programming, Print, Physics, Hunting, Defence, Martial Arts, Survival, Mechanics, Electronics, Mobility, History, Music Production, Photography, Cine, Manufacturing, Arts, Tourism, Services, Sound, Medicine, Navigation, etc. I lost count of the books and being connected to the internet all My life made the study a habit. Honestly, the more I learn the less I know about Our brief time on this small sphere We call Earth.

HOW TO HIRE ME
I am a French Citizen, Independent Designer and Creative Freelance. I live in Mexico at the moment, I am Mexican too. Write Me to 1@pibr.fr Tell Me about You, explain Me what do you need and after some eMails, PhoneCalls, VideoChats, Messages or Perhaps Meetings We will interchange creative work for the right price. Simple. Never send money to others! I work alone, just Me.

WEBSITE
Me or My Providers do not collect any personal data or information. Unless a Payment transaction is made using a form or Payment Service (I Use PayPal or direct Bank Deposits). Contact forms will only send the provided data to My emails (is the same as writing directly). Perhaps My ISP DataCenters in Canadá and France and Software Providers will identify the kind of web browser You use to enhance the visualising experience in different devices. I avoid the use of Data Bases to increase the security and simplicity of My Web Pages to be able to Update more often. I am My own Webmaster, Designer, Programer, Debugger, Employee and Boss, I work alone, just Me (maybe in the Future My Children like My Business). So if You see an error, remember that I am a Human and please let Me know. If You like My Website or the ones I made for others, I can make one for You too!

		<div>I am Alberto Pickering Brunel form 1983, Pacifist Freelance Industrial Designer, Graphic Designer, Art Director, Technical Draftsman, Illustrator, Photographer, Desktop Publisher, Web Designer, UI|UX Designer, Digital Sculptor, Annimator, Printer, Sound Designer, Electronic Music Producer & Amateur Writer/Musician. Divorced, Father of Albert Pickering Jr. & Sophia Pickering.

I prey for global peace, war is not the last option anymore; Our resources as Humans are in danger, the next Generations will have less Nature.

Everyday We can make our only habitable World better, respect is an intelligence basic that must start all relationships and surpass all challenges in the light-fast life We all have.

With simple communication and focus an idea can be transformed in a message to the world or a product that will make life better.

Here I am, ready to take the next great big or small project. I work alone, the only Boss and Employee in My Business, no Partners, Managers, Promotors, no one else than Me.

I am cosntantly updating My online Portfolio WebPages. One of My future plans is write a book of My life, but I am young :) wait for it.

		<div>My work in Aerospace is completely open to science. As a French/Mexican Citizen and a Fan of Scientist with My same Last name that made History to put “Pickering” in Mars and the Moon and directed the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory I have always being fascinated by Space Missions. Before the internet I spend years reading TimeLife encyclopaedias and books of Space Missions, Nature, Science, History and Civilisations in My home and Brittanica with My GrandPas, I remember watch live on TV with My Dad the Challenger catastrophe. As a SETI Online Member since the 90s and Industrial Designer My few personal projects that I always shared have the same focus of the Space Agencies around Earth; Explore the Universe and protect life in and outside Earth. My artistic conceptual sketches, drawings, illustrations and 3D models are not copies of real Aerospace technology, if something I have made looks similar it can be a coincidence or the influence of past education and media exposure that could be used as reference, guide or motivation to represent an idea with the intention of help Humanity in Space exploration and Science. Under any circumstance My intention is to break the privacy or put any space mission in risk. Please feel free contact Me at any time, perhaps I can help Space and I will be happy to hear or read Your comments.

		<div>My GrandPas and Uncles used to drive a lot in the highway and it was amazing, My Dad teach Me how to drive at 12 in a parking lot in an Opel Corsa, then a VW Bug, a Chrysler New Yorker, a Ford Taurus and a Nissan Altima, I remember My Father’s Corsar and My Mother’s Atlantic, in My Dad’s office He had some VW Buses. I remember a crash in a tubular buggy in a race, the helmet worked! Cars is a never ending story, I had a Pontiac Sunfire, a Subaru Outback (that someone robbed Me!) and My favourite 1988 Jaguar XJ40 :) I have sketch, draw, illustrate, modelled and 3D modelled hundreds of vehicles with wheels during my 42 years of life, I will try to share all I have, be calmed Design takes a lot of time… Investors and Manufacturers are welcome to contact Me at any time as well as anyone else that loves cars.</div>

		<div>Before studying Industrial Design, back in the late 90’s studied Industrial Technical Drawing and won a technical degree, the first 2 years of the career I drew on tracing paper with pencils and stylographs mechanical parts, views, isometrics and perspectives, the las year I learn Architecture basics and drew Architectural plants, views and perspectives, I also built some scaled projects with cardboard and scale models, textures, etc, Later on High School differential calculus help Me with some bridges models. I built scale models of vehicles since I was a Kid and I play with Playmobils even with My Children, I seat everyday in My old wood stool and My Daughter Sophia has My old drafting desk that exist since the 80s, I spend many years drawing in My Mother’s Italian Neolt drafting desk with the best tools (Staedtler, Rotring, Kern, Koh-i-Noor, K&E, Schooner, etc.), I miss the universal ruler (drafting machine) . My experience in Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Photography, Audio, Printing, Arts, etc. over the past decades helps Me to fill the gaps in this amazing area of essential creativity in magnificent scales. I have read and buy many books about Architecture from drawing to decoration (My GrandMa was a Decorator, My Mother is a Graphic Designer and I still use the old compasses, dividers and ruling pens of My Great-grand Father Monsieur Ernest Brunel from 1869 a French Architect and Engineer that built bridges and buildings as the “Mercado Hidalgo" in Guanajuato Mexique, Gustav Eiffel was his Friend). I plotted some plants in My Graphtec Plotter in the past and printed some renders too, I will include what I can find mostly recent years sketches and 3D Models of homes, buildings, bridges and even Martian huts. My Son Albert likes Architecture too, maybe one day we will built something, like a new roof for Pickering Castle :)
